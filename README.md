Warning: NPE

Base skidded from Deluge which is skidded from disco-ball. I just skidded it kuz I like the gui, no other reason.

All the AAC & NCP speeds except AAC 4.2 are ~~stolen~~ *inspired* from LiquidBounce. I made the AAC 4.2 speeds myself.

Skidded from:
- Base - Deluges
- AAC & NCP Speed = LiquidBounce
- Some other stuff: FusionX
- A bit of other things. Wurst
